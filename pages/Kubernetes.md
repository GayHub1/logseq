title:: Kubernetes

- ## 简介
  collapsed:: true
	- ### 什么是Kubernetes
	  collapsed:: true
		- 一个为 容器化 应用提供集群部署和管理的开源工具，由 Google 开发。
		- Kubernetes 可以为你提供集中式的管理集群机器和应用，加机器、版本升级、版本回滚，那都是一个命令就搞定的事，不停机的灰度更新，确保高可用、高性能、高扩展。
	- ### 主要特性
	  collapsed:: true
		- 高可用，不宕机，自动灾难恢复
		- 灰度更新，不影响业务正常运转
		- 一键回滚到历史版本
		- 方便的伸缩扩展（应用伸缩，机器加减）、提供负载均衡
		  有一个完善的生态
	- ## 不同的应用部署方案
	  collapsed:: true
		- ![Replaced by Image Uploder](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/GayHub1/images@master/img/image_1657116813488_0.png)
		- 传统部署方式
		  collapsed:: true
			- 应用直接在物理机上部署，机器资源分配不好控制，出现Bug时，可能机器的大部分资源被某个应用占用，导致其他应用无法正常运行，无法做到应用隔离。
		- 虚拟机部署
		  collapsed:: true
			- 在单个物理机上运行多个虚拟机，每个虚拟机都是完整独立的系统，性能损耗大。
		- 容器部署
		  collapsed:: true
			- 所有容器共享主机的系统，轻量级的虚拟机，性能损耗小，资源隔离，CPU和内存可按需分配
	- ## 集群架构
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### Master与worker
		  collapsed:: true
			- ![Replaced by Image Uploder](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/GayHub1/images@master/img/image_1657116981321_0.png)
			- master
			  collapsed:: true
				- 主节点，控制平台，不需要很高性能，不跑任务，通常一个就行了，也可以开多个主节点来提高集群可用度。
			- worker
			  collapsed:: true
				- 工作节点，可以是虚拟机或物理计算机，任务都在这里跑，机器性能需要好点；通常都有很多个，可以不断加机器扩大集群；每个工作节点由主节点管理
		- ### Pod
		  collapsed:: true
			- ![Replaced by Image Uploder](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/GayHub1/images@master/img/image_1657117094875_0.png)
			- K8S 调度、管理的最小单位，一个 Pod 可以包含一个或多个容器，每个 Pod 有自己的虚拟IP。
			- 一个工作节点可以有多个 pod，主节点会考量负载自动调度 pod 到哪个节点运行。
			- **StatefulSet**: 定义一组有状态Pod,K8S将自动维护
			- **Deployment**: 定义一组无状态Pod,K8S将自动维护
			- **Service**: 一组Pod的抽象访问方式，相当于负载均衡器
		- ### 组件
		  collapsed:: true
			- ![Replaced by Image Uploder](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/GayHub1/images@master/img/image_1657117769317_0.png)
			- kube-apiserver
			  collapsed:: true
				- API 服务器，公开了 Kubernetes API
			- etcd
			  collapsed:: true
				- 键值数据库，可以作为保存 Kubernetes 所有集群数据的后台数据库
			- kube-scheduler
			  collapsed:: true
				- 调度 Pod 到哪个节点运行
			- kube-controller
			  collapsed:: true
				- 集群控制器
			- cloud-controller
			  collapsed:: true
				- 与云服务商交互
			- [官网详情](https://kubernetes.io/zh-cn/docs/concepts/overview/components/)
- ## 安装 Kubernetes 集群
  collapsed:: true
	- > 非云平台均需要Docker环境
	- ### minikube
	  collapsed:: true
		- 只是一个 K8S 集群模拟器，只有一个节点的集群，只为测试用，master 和 worker 都在一起
		- [安装方法](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
		- Windows
			- ```sh
			  winget install minikube
			  ```
	- ### 云平台 Kubernetes
	  collapsed:: true
		- 可视化搭建，只需简单几步就可以创建好一个集群。
		  优点：安装简单，生态齐全，负载均衡器、存储等都给你配套好，简单操作就搞定
		- [腾讯云容器服务 TKE](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/tke) （控制台搜索容器）
		  登录阿里云控制台 - 产品搜索 Kubernetes
	- ### 裸机安装（Bare Metal）
	  collapsed:: true
		- 缺点
		  collapsed:: true
			- 至少需要两台机器（主节点、工作节点个一台），需要自己安装 Kubernetes 组件，配置会稍微麻烦点。
			  可以到各云厂商按时租用服务器，费用低，用完就销毁。
			  缺点：配置麻烦，缺少生态支持，例如负载均衡器、云存储。
		- 主节点需要组件
		  collapsed:: true
			- docker（也可以是其他容器运行时）
			- kubectl 集群命令行交互工具
			- kubeadm 集群初始化工具
		- 工作节点需要组件
		  collapsed:: true
			- docker（也可以是其他容器运行时）
			- kubelet 管理 Pod 和容器，确保他们健康稳定运行。

					- 在节点上，我们可以  `curl http://localhost:31000/hello/easydoc`  访问到应用
				- **Loadbalancer**
				  collapsed:: true
					- 也可以对外提供服务，这需要一个负载均衡器的支持，因为它需要生成一个新的 IP 对外服务，否则状态就一直是 pendding，这个很少用了，后面我们会讲更高端的 Ingress 来代替它。

- ## **StatefulSet**
  collapsed:: true
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1657983723836_0.png)
	- 会固定每个 Pod 的名字，用于有状的副本 如 Redis,数据库
	- 特性
	  collapsed:: true
		- Service 的  `CLUSTER-IP`  是空的，Pod 名字也是固定的(1,2,3)。
		  collapsed:: true
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1657983552165_0.png)
		- Pod 创建和销毁是有序的，创建是顺序的，销毁是逆序的。
		- Pod 重建不会改变名字，除了IP，所以不要用IP直连
	- yaml
	  collapsed:: true
		- ```yaml
		          apiVersion: apps/v1

	- 建议直接使用 Service 名字连接，会随机转发请求
	- 要连接指定 Pod，可以这样 `pod-name.service-name`
- ## 数据持久化

	- #### Persistent Volume (PV)
	  collapsed:: true
		- 描述卷的具体信息，例如磁盘大小，[访问模式](https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes)。[文档](https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)，[类型](https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#types-of-persistent-volumes)，[Local 示例](https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local)

		              values:
		                - node2
		  
		          ```
	- #### Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
	  collapsed:: true
		- 对存储需求的一个申明，可以理解为一个申请单，系统根据这个申请单去找一个合适的 PV
		  还可以根据 PVC 自动创建 PV。
		- ```
		          apiVersion: v1
		          kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
		          metadata:
		  name: mongodata
		          spec:
		  accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
		  storageClassName: "local-storage"
		  resources:
		    requests:
		      storage: 2Gi
		  
		          ```
	- 多层抽象特性
	  collapsed:: true
		- 更好的分工，运维人员负责提供好存储，开发人员不需要关注磁盘细节，只需要写一个申请单。
		- 方便云服务商提供不同类型的，配置细节不需要开发者关注，只需要一个申请单。
		- [动态创建](https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/)，开发人员写好申请单后，供应商可以根据需求自动创建所需存储卷。

- ## **ConfigMap & Secret**
  collapsed:: true
	- ### ConfigMap
	  collapsed:: true
		- 数据库连接地址，这种可能根据部署环境变化的，我们不应该写死在代码里。
		  Kubernetes 为我们提供了 ConfigMap，可以方便的配置一些变量。[文档](https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/)
		- `configmap.yaml`
			- ```
			             apiVersion: v1
			             kind: ConfigMap
			             metadata:
			               name: mongo-config
			             data:
			               mongoHost: mongodb-0.mongodb
			             ```
			  
			             ```
			             # 应用
			             kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml
			             # 查看
			             kubectl get configmap mongo-config -o yaml
			             ```
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1658041304679_0.png)
	- ### Secret
	  collapsed:: true
		- 一些重要数据，例如密码、TOKEN，我们可以放到 secret 中。[文档](https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)，[配置证书](https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secret)
		- > 注意，数据要进行 Base64 编码。
		- `secret.yaml`
			- ```
			  apiVersion: v1
			  kind: Secret
			  metadata:
			    name: mongo-secret
			  # Opaque 用户定义的任意数据，更多类型介绍 https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#secret-types
			  type: Opaque
			  data:
			    # 数据要 base64。https://tools.fun/base64.html
			    mongo-username: bW9uZ291c2Vy
			    mongo-password: bW9uZ29wYXNz
			  ```
			  
			  
			  ```
			  # 应用
			  kubectl apply -f secret.yaml
			  # 查看
			  kubectl get secret mongo-secret -o yaml
			  ```

	- 使用方法
		- ##### 作为环境变量使用
		  collapsed:: true
			- ```
			  apiVersion: apps/v1
			  kind: StatefulSet
			  metadata:
			  name: mongodb
			  spec:
			  replicas: 3
			  selector:
			    matchLabels:
			      app: mongodb

			          image: mongo:4.4
			          # IfNotPresent 仅本地没有镜像时才远程拉，Always 永远都是从远程拉，Never 永远只用本地镜像，本地没有则报错
			          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
			          env:
			          - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME
			            valueFrom:
			              secretKeyRef:
			                name: mongo-secret
			                key: mongo-username
			          - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD
			            valueFrom:
			              secretKeyRef:
			                name: mongo-secret
			                key: mongo-password
			          # Secret 的所有数据定义为容器的环境变量，Secret 中的键名称为 Pod 中的环境变量名称
			          # envFrom:
			          # - secretRef:
			          #     name: mongo-secret
			  ```
		- ##### 挂载为文件（更适合证书文件）
		  collapsed:: true
			- 挂载后，会在容器中对应路径生成文件，一个 key 一个文件，内容就是 value，[文档](https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-secrets-as-files-from-a-pod)
			- ```
			  apiVersion: v1
			  kind: Pod
			  metadata:
			  name: mypod
			  spec:
			  containers:
			  - name: mypod
			    image: redis
			    volumeMounts:
			    - name: foo
			      mountPath: "/etc/foo"
			      readOnly: true
			  volumes:
			  - name: foo
			    secret:
			      secretName: mysecret
			  ```
- ## **Helm**
  collapsed:: true
	- ### 介绍
		- `Helm` 类似 npm，pip，docker hub, 可以理解为是一个软件库，可以方便快速的为我们的集群安装一些第三方软件。
		- 使用 Helm 我们可以非常方便的就搭建出来 MongoDB / MySQL 副本集群，YAML 文件别人都给我们写好了，直接使用。[官网](https://helm.sh/zh/)，[应用中心](https://artifacthub.io/)
	- ### 安装 Helm
	  collapsed:: true
		- 安装 [文档](https://helm.sh/zh/docs/intro/install/) [Github](https://github.com/helm/helm)
		- 脚本安装（需要科学）
		  collapsed:: true
			- `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash`
		- ### 用二进制版本安装
		  collapsed:: true
			- 每个Helm [版本](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases)都提供了各种操作系统的二进制版本，这些版本可以手动下载和安装。
			- 下载 [需要的版本](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases)
			- 解压( `tar -zxvf helm-v3.0.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz` )
			- 在解压目中找到 `helm` 程序，移动到需要的目录中( `mv linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm` )
			-
	- ### 安装 MongoDB 示例
	  collapsed:: true
		- ```
		          # 安装
		          helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
		          helm install my-mongo bitnami/mongodb
		  
		          # 指定密码和架构
		          helm install my-mongo bitnami/mongodb --set architecture="replicaset",auth.rootPassword="mongopass"
		  
		          # 删除
		          helm ls
		          heml delete my-mongo
		  
		          # 查看密码
		          kubectl get secret my-mongo-mongodb -o json
		          kubectl get secret my-mongo-mongodb -o yaml > secret.yaml
		  
		          # 临时运行一个包含 mongo client 的 debian 系统
		          kubectl run mongodb-client --rm --tty -i --restart='Never' --image docker.io/bitnami/mongodb:4.4.10-debian-10-r20 --command -- bash
		  
		          # 进去 mongodb
		          mongo --host "my-mongo-mongodb" -u root -p mongopass
		  
		          # 也可以转发集群里的端口到宿主机访问 mongodb
		          kubectl port-forward svc/my-mongo-mongodb 27017:27018
		          ```
- ## 命名空间
  collapsed:: true
	- 如果一个集群中部署了多个应用，所有应用都在一起，就不太好管理，也可以导致名字冲突等。
	  我们可以使用 namespace 把应用划分到不同的命名空间，跟代码里的 namespace 是一个概念，只是为了划分空间。
	- 命令
	  collapsed:: true
		- ```
		          # 创建命名空间
		          kubectl create namespace testapp
		          # 部署应用到指定的命名空间
		          kubectl apply -f app.yml --namespace testapp
		          # 查询
		          kubectl get pod --namespace kube-system
		          ```
	- 可以用 [kubens](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) 快速切换 namespace
	  collapsed:: true
		- 安装
		  collapsed:: true
			- ```sh
			             sudo git clone https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx /opt/kubectx
			             sudo ln -s /opt/kubectx/kubectx /usr/local/bin/kubectx
			             sudo ln -s /opt/kubectx/kubens /usr/local/bin/kubens
			             ```
		- 命令
			- ```
			             # 切换命名空间
			             kubens kube-system
			             # 回到上个命名空间
			             kubens -
			             # 切换集群
			             kubectx minikube
			             ```
- ## Ingress
  collapsed:: true
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1658065297029_0.png)
	- ### 介绍
		- Ingress 为外部访问集群提供了一个 **统一** 入口，避免了对外暴露集群端口；
		  功能类似 Nginx，可以根据域名、路径把请求转发到不同的 Service。
		  可以配置 https
	- ### 使用
		- 要使用 Ingress，需要一个负载均衡器 + Ingress Controller
		  如果是裸机（bare metal) 搭建的集群，你需要自己安装一个负载均衡插件，可以安装 [METALLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/)
		  如果是云服务商，会自动给你配置，否则你的外部 IP 会是 “pending” 状态，无法使用。
		- 文档：[Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)
		  Minikube 中部署 Ingress Controller：[nginx](https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/ingress-minikube/)
		  Helm 安装： [Nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#quick-start)
